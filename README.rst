SarPy
=====

SarPy is a basic Python library to read, write, display, and do simple processing
of complex SAR data using the NGA `SICD <http://www.gwg.nga.mil/ntb/baseline/docs/SICD/>`_
format. It has been released by NGA to encourage the use of SAR data standards
throughout the international SAR community. SarPy complements the
`SIX <https://github.com/ngageoint/six-library>`_ library (C++) and the
`MATLAB SAR Toolbox <https://github.com/ngageoint/MATLAB_SAR>`_, which are
implemented in other languages but have similar goals.

Some sample SICD files can be found `here <https://github.com/ngageoint/six-library/wiki/Sample-SICDs>`_.

In addition to SICD, SarPy can also read COSMO-SkyMed, RADARSAT-2, Radar Constellation Mission (RCM),
and Sentinel-1 SLC formats and convert them to SICD.

Some examples of how to read complex SAR data using SarPy are provided in docs/sarpy_example.py.
